rest9 is a rest api framework that allows you to quickly set up an API.

All you need to do is to create distinct classes with all the functionalities needed.

Security:

Please note that all the public methods in your classes will be callable from the API,
so be sure that the only public methods are those that have operations that don't
put in risk your API.
